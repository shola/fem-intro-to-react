 I highly recommend taking the Front End Masters course, it is the first tutorial/guides I have seen in the last few months that make react (and the tooling around it: webpack, linting, babel) approachable.
 
 ## WARNING
 #### This repo will be a little screwy until I finish working through all the examples. After I have worked through them, I'll edit them to make it possible for others to get the app working with no surprises (like CSS issues)
 
 This repo contains commits that roughly correspond to once-per-episode from the above Front End Masters course. I add to the content occasionally because I've found that's the best way I've found to test my understanding of the concepts.
 
 Some things I have added:
 - Flow for static prop/state checks
