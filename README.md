This repo contains commits that roughly correspond to once-per-episode from the above Front End Masters course. I add to the content occasionally because I've found that's the best way I've found to test my understanding of the concepts. If you check out this repo, I encourage the same.

 I highly recommend taking the Front End Masters course, it is the first tutorial/guides I have seen in the last few months that make react (and the tooling around it: webpack, linting, babel) approachable.
